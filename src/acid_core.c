/* Acid -- dual generative acid-bassline sequencer, slot MIDI FX for Schwung.
 *
 * Two independent 8..32-step generators (Seq A / Seq B) free-run off Move's
 * transport, sharing one Root/Scale. Each sequencer's own "Algo" knob (1-16)
 * blends a primary generator (density/accent/slide/octave probabilistic
 * model, ported from schwung-tb3po / the Phazerville TB_3PO applet) with a
 * secondary generator (Sting.amxd-inspired: urn-style non-repeating pitch
 * draw, a density-modulated bounded random walk for gate/rest, and a fixed
 * permutation ("VelPyra") accent shape instead of independent per-step
 * accent rolls). Algo=1 is 100% primary -- byte-for-byte the same generation
 * behaviour as tb3po's model. Algo=16 is mostly secondary.
 *
 * Because a MIDI FX slot forwards process_midi/tick output to exactly ONE
 * synth on ONE channel (chain_midi.c overwrites the channel byte with the
 * slot's recv channel regardless of what we send), Seq A and Seq B are not
 * routed to separate synths the way tb3po's two Tool slots are. Instead
 * both merge into the single output stream, mixed by a bipolar Blend knob
 * (-63..64) that crossfades the two by scaling each side's own velocity:
 * -63 = A only @127, 0 = both @100, +64 = B only @127.
 *
 * Blend doubles as Seq B's on/off -- at -63 it mutes B outright -- so the
 * knob that would otherwise be a B enable is Tune B instead: B's interval
 * from A in semitones (+/-24), layered on top of Root and live transpose.
 *
 * Swing (50-75%, MPC-style 16th) is shared by both sequencers off one
 * clock, so they always stay swung together regardless of Reset Both or
 * differing lengths -- see swing_delay_frac()/swing_gap_mult() for the
 * timing math.
 *
 * No banks, no undo, no persistence in this version -- Generate/Mutate only.
 * An incoming note-on transposes both sequencers live, relative to C4
 * (hybrid trigger model) -- the Root knob is left untouched, and Tune B's
 * interval rides along, so A and B stay locked at the interval you set.
 * Sequencing itself keeps running regardless of note input.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Ported to the Akai Force (MockbaMod): verbatim from schwung-acid except
 * for one addition, marked FORCE-ONLY throughout. Move's chain host forces
 * every MIDI FX slot onto one output channel (see above) -- Force's host
 * (src/host_shim.cpp, a standalone RtMidi process, not a chain slot) has no
 * such restriction, so tb3po's original two-separate-outputs design becomes
 * possible again: each sequencer gets its own independently selectable
 * output channel (a_channel/b_channel). Blend is unchanged and still applies
 * on top -- splitting to two channels doesn't retire it, it just means the
 * two sides can *also* land on separate instrument tracks. Search
 * FORCE-ONLY for every touch point; see DESIGN.md for the rest of the
 * Move/Force delta list.

 * FORCE-ONLY: CV Mode (t->cv_mode) retargets both of the above for a Force
 * CV track feeding external CV/Gate/Accent/Slide hardware (e.g. a Behringer

 *   - accent is carried by velocity ALONE, at the widest possible swing (1

 *     to Velocity reads a clean, near-full-scale step between "no accent"

 *     velocity-sensitive synth's own dynamics respond, not for a linear CV
 *     line, and is far too narrow a swing for that use.
 *   - Blend's vel_scale is deliberately NOT applied to the CV-mode velocity:
 *     Blend crossfades two sequencers sharing ONE audio destination, but CV
 *     Mode is for routing each sequencer to its OWN separate CV/Gate
 *     hardware, so scaling the accent-CV level by an unrelated mix control
 *     would corrupt the reading (a mid-Blend setting would report a full
 *     accent as something less than full-scale).
 *   - slide is sent as CC1 (Mod Wheel) instead of CC65 (Portamento), since
 *     Mod Wheel is the CC a Force CV track's own CV-row assignment menu
 *     expects for a non-pitch/velocity/gate row (see docs/CC-MAP.md). The
